              <h2>City Overview</h2>
              <p>Denver is the capital city of Colorado. As Colorado's only true main urban hub, Denver is unique in its size and access to city lifestyle. With a population of around <span class="highlight">715,522 people</span> (United States Census Bureau, Denver County, Colorado 2024),
                Denver is far and away, the most populated area of Colorado. The city still provides a good indicator of its history as a western mining town that settled during the Pike's Peak gold rush in <span class="highlight">1858</span> (Denver Visitors Bureau, Denver, Colorado history 2024). The governing bodies of Colorado work hard to preserve
              the history of the city. Even though it is a large urban area, people living in Denver enjoy its "small city" feel and its access to surrounding outdoor areas, especially the Rocky Mountains. For those who are staying in the city, there is really
            great access to different cultural activities and dining. Denver is also home to many sports teams and arenas, and Denverites are typically diehard fans of local teams.

            <section id="regioneconomy">
              <h2>Region and Economy</h2>
              <p>Denver is located directly east of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, which make up the <span class="highlight">front range area</span> of the state. Most of the biggest cities and populated areas lie in this state area. Being in this area makes Denver a great place for those who like to have fairly good access to the
                mountains or move along the front range to other popular cities in the state. The average income in Denver
              is <span class="highlight">$88,213</span> (United States Census Bureau, Denver County, Colorado 2024), which is only slightly less than the state average of <span class="highlight">$89,302</span> (Bureau, State of Colorado 2022) and is indicative of the city lifestyle enjoyed here.

              <h2>Tourism and Activities</h2>
              <p>Denver itself is home to a lot of great dining and tourism. There are plenty of ways to spend time in the mile-high city, from its historical landmarks to museums and theatres. Many activities are available around the city, including
                the Museum of Natural History, the Denver Zoo, and one of the many art museums found in Denver. Denver also has several art districts where visitors can see local artists or enjoy many commissioned street art pieces. If dining
              is important, Denver is also home to some incredible restaurants. The city has many dining options, from casual eating to high-class restaurants. Denver recently had the honor of being added to the Michelin guide as one of the cities where restaurants
            are eligible to receive michelin stars, a highly regarded award for world-class restaurants (United States Census Bureau, Denver County, Colorado 2024).
